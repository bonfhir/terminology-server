Welcome to the Bonfhir Terminology Server wiki!

This wiki currently only contains the RFCs (Request for Comments) for the Bonfhir Terminology Server. Each RFC is a proposal for a new feature or enhancement to the Terminology Server. The purpose of the RFCs is to provide a structured and transparent process for discussing and evaluating new ideas, and to gather feedback from the community.

Eventually, the wiki will be expanded to include other documentation and resources related to the Terminology Server.
