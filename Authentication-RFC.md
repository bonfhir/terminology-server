# Context

The Terminology Server is built using HAPI FHIR which is a Java implementation of the HL7 FHIR standard. When adding an authentication layer to HAPI FHIR, we need to consider the specific requirements and constraints of healthcare applications. This Terminology Server is meant as either a development tool or a building block for more complex health systems.
